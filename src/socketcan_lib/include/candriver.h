/**
 * \brief base class for hydro drivers using CAN. Your specific HydroDriver should inherit this
 * \par it connects to the CAN bus and may print out the received messages
 * \par This class is not specific to the Car Freedom, it should be used to other can stuff
 * @uses SocketCAN it includes a SocketCAN object to handle the communication
 * @see constructor for filter string format.
 * \par IMPORTANT: this class can be used in two ways.
 * \li as a socketcan_lib::caninterface it should be used to read canframes. In this case you should not include this file, include <socketcan_lib::caninterface.h> , like candump does. In this way candump can choose between this simple driver and CANPrint, which prints much more pretty messages specifc to the car. In this way you are using this class, not inheriting it.
 * \li as a CANDriver itself. in this case you should include this file directly, like the hydrodriver hydrocarfreedom does. Actually hydrocarfreedom::Driver inherits this class. In this way you are inheriting this class.
